### Problem Setting
Fires in natural areas whether it is in a forest, natural park, or any other natural setting, is also called wildfires. Wildfires feed on natural combustion materials such as bushes, wood, and so on. Wildfires can either start due to natural reasons such as drought or in rare cases lighting but they could also occur due to human factors such as burning campfires or cigarettes. There are 3 factors that wildfire needs to grow any combustion materials natural or otherwise, oxygen and a heat source, then depending on environmental factors such as wind, the amount of fuel/combustion material near, and so on.

According to this [report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf), wildfires in the US alone since 2000 have been reported to have an annual average of 70,072 burning in the process an annual average of 7.0 million acres. 

Wildfires can cause a wide variety of issues as the amount of animal, and human lives fatalities in the process are not negligible, in addition to the effect it has on the ecosystem and biodiversity. Wildfires release a considerable amount of greenhouse gases as well that are recognized as air pollutants.
There is agreement in the scientific community that climate change is contributing to the increased risk of wildfires and therefore would mean that wildfires would occur more frequently. Some regions take decades to recover for the ecosystem to recover from the damage caused by the wildfire.

A timely response to the wildfire and correctly estimating the size and severity of the fire can be of crucial importance. 

In this project, I attempt to use a machine learning approach to accurately predict the area affected by a wildfire using the data of the Fire-Wheather-Index (FWI) and thus responding appropriately to the fire breakouts. In the machine learning world, this problem would be considered a regression problem since the prediction variable(affected area) is continuous.
